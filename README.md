Prerequisites
=============

Custom version of NS-3 and specified version of ndnSIM needs to be installed.

The code should also work with the latest version of ndnSIM, but it is not guaranteed.

    git clone git@github.com:cawka/ns-3-dev-ndnSIM.git -b ns-3.17-ndnSIM-0.5 ns-3
    git clone git@github.com:NDN-Routing/ndnSIM.git ns-3/src/ndnSIM
	(cd ns-3/src/ndnSIM && git checkout -b comcom 52a09bd99af4ba00827ab47eab55c6e0e302494a)

    cd ns-3
    ./waf configure
    ./waf install

For more information how to install NS-3 and ndnSIM, please refer to http://ndnsim.net website.

Compiling
=========

``./waf configure``

or (configure in debug mode with logging enabled)

``./waf configure --debug``

If you have installed NS-3 in a non-standard location, you may need to set up ``PKG_CONFIG_PATH`` variable.
For example, if NS-3 is installed in /usr/local/, then the following command should be used to
configure scenario

``PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig ./waf configure``

or

``PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig ./waf configure --debug``

Running
=======

Normally, you can run scenarios either directly

``./build/<scenario_name>``

or using waf

``./waf --run <scenario_name>``

If NS-3 is installed in a non-standard location, on some platforms (e.g., Linux) you need to specify ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` variable:

``LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib ./build/<scenario_name>``

or

``LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib ./waf --run <scenario_name>``


When running using ./waf, it is possible to run scenario with visualizer:

``./waf --run <scenario_name> --vis``


Available simulations
=====================

One-flow congestion scenario in a simple topology (Figure 9)
------------------------------------------------------------

Figure 9 from "A Case for Stateful Forwarding Plane" paper:

Simulation scenario for NDN flows:

    scenarios/congestion-zoom-ndn.cc

Simulation scenario for TCP flows:

    scenarios/congestion-zoom-tcp.cc

To automatically run simulations and build a graph for the simulation:

    ./waf
    ./run.py -s figure-9-one-flow-congestion

To rebuild the graph without rerunning the simulation:

    ./run.py figure-9-one-flow-congestion

User ``./run.py -h`` for other options.

**Note that provided scripts rely on R (http://www.r-project.org/) with ggplot2 module to be installed.**

20-flow congestion scenario in Sprint POP topology (Figure 10)
--------------------------------------------------------------

Simulation scenario for NDN flows:

    scenarios/congestion-pop-ndn.cc

Simulation scenario for TCP flows:

    scenarios/congestion-pop-tcp.cc

To automatically run simulations and build a graph for the simulation:

    ./waf
    ./run.py -s figure-10-twenty-flow-congestion

To rebuild the graph without rerunning the simulation:

    ./run.py figure-10-twenty-flow-congestion

User ``./run.py -h`` for other options.
